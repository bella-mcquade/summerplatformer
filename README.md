# Summerplatformer
A Platformer game I worked on over the summer as a way to learn Unity and challenge myself.
In this game, you play as a being that restores color and life to the world as it moves through it.
Currently I have finished about half of the forest level.

I followed a instructional video found here for the base game setup: [ADD LINK]

One of the forest enemies you could face. This one is called the Deerguard.
